%description
This program shows up in the notification area, and it listens for output
produced by hardware MIDI devices, such as a synthesizer keyboard.

While the device is being played with, the program prevents the desktop from
entering idle mode, which might lock the session or activate the screen saver.
For instance, one can practice a piece of music on screen without risks of
interruption.
